        <h2>Overview</h2>
The ActiveRaUL system consists of two main parts:
<ul>
               <li>
<b>RESTful Web service</b> that provides a uniform way to manage widgets and the
data that is processed by the widgets. It supports CRUD operations, such as storing and querying RDF data, on the underlying data store via HTTP requests. Additionally, the service provides a mechanism to produce and
render widgets via RDFa annotated XHTML forms.</li></br>

<li><b>Client-side JavaScript RDFa API</b> based on jQuery and enables the direct
interaction between the user (or more precisely the generated widgets) and the Ac-
tiveRaUL service. The API supports RDFa parsing of the annotated XHTML forms
and encapsulates the communication with the backend service. A major aspect of
client-side processing is the transparent databinding of values stored in the backend
or in the Linked Data Web to controls comprised in the widgets. This includes up-
dating the RDF triples in the backend and pre-populating existing forms if data is
available.</li>
            </ul>
        <h2><a href="widgets.html">RaUL Widget elements</a></h2>
        RaUL defines a widget ontology that supports all HTML form elements.
        Example widget elements are:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="textbox.html">raul:Textbox</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="group.html">raul:Group</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="listbox.html">raul:Listbox</a>
            </li>
         </ul>
The full ontology can be found at: <a href="http://purl.org/NET/raul#">http://purl.org/NET/raul#</a>.

        <h2><a href="demo.html">Demo</a></h2>
        <p>
        Our use case simulates a second-hand goods trading platform at which registered
users can sell and buy second-hand goods. For demonstration purposes, and later
for understanding the value provided by our approach, we consider a scenario in
which a typical user performs three basic (yet common) operations: registration, selling a product and buying a product. 
        <ol>
            <li>

<b>User Registration.</b> A new seller/buyer needs to register for a new user account to
act on the e-Commerce website. The user requests the registration form, which
offers him the standard fields to fill in his user data. One option would be to directly use the FOAF profile.</li>


<li>
<b>Product Advertisement.</b> A user, once registered, can add products for selling. The associated form / widget consists of examples of common fields used to describe a product. Similar to the first operation, the user could reuse an existing description of the product on the Linked Data Web, by entering
the product's URI.</li>


<li>
<b>Bid on a Product.</b> Finally, the user may want to purchase an advertised product.
The product can be easily found by filling in the form / widget. The user can then bid for the product.</li>

            </li>
         </ol>
        </p>

        <p>
        The ActiveRaUL Web service is implemented with the Java API for XML Web Services (JAX-WS). Please use the link below to download the latest version of the Web application archive for deployment on an Apache Tomcat server.
